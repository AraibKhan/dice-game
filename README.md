# Dice Game

Welcome to the Dice Game! This is a simple JavaScript project that allows two players to play a dice game. In this game, Player 1 will roll the dice, and based on the outcome, they can accumulate points or lose their turn.

## How to Play

1. Open the Dice Game in your preferred web browser.
2. The game starts with Player 1. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.
3. The number on the dice will be added to Player 1's temporary score.
4. Player 1 has two options:

- Hold: Click the "Hold" button to add the temporary score to the current total and end your turn.
- Roll Again: Click the "Roll Again" button to roll the dice again and potentially add more points to your temporary score.

5. If Player 1 rolls a 1, their temporary score will reset to zero, and their turn ends.
6. Once Player 1 decides to hold or rolls a 1, it becomes Player 2's turn.
7. Player 2 follows the same rules as Player 1.
8. The game continues alternating between Player 1 and Player 2 until one of the players reaches a predefined winning score (e.g., 100 points).
9. The player who reaches the winning score first is declared the winner, and the game ends.
